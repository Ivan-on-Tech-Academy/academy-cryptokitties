/** ****************************************************************************
 * @notice Interface for contracts using VRF randomness
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev PURPOSE
 *
 * @dev Reggie the Random Oracle (not his real job) wants to provide randomness
 * @dev to Vera the verifier in such a way that Vera can be sure he's not
 * @dev making his output up to suit himself. Reggie provides Vera a public key
 * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to
 * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely
 * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.
 *
 * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was
 * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,
 * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample
 * @dev from the output space.
 *
 * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts
 * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide
 * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness.
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev USAGE
 *
 * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerInterface, and can
 * @dev initialize VRFConsumerInterface's attributes in their constructor as
 * @dev shown:
 *
 * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {
 * @dev     constuctor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)
 * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) public {
 * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>
 * @dev       }
 * @dev   }
 *
 * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have
 * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash), and have told you the minimum LINK
 * @dev price for VRF service. Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and
 * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you
 * @dev want to generate randomness from.
 *
 * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response
 * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.
 *
 * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value
 * @dev generated from your seed.
 *
 * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by
 * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent
 * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is
 * @dev associated with which randomness. See VRFRequestIDBase.sol for more
 * @dev details.
 *
 * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds
 * @dev differ. (Which is critical to making unpredictable randomness! See the
 * @dev next section.)
 *
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
 *
 * @dev To increase trust in your contract, the source of your seeds should be
 * @dev hard for anyone to influence or predict. Any party who can influence
 * @dev them could in principle collude with the oracle (who can instantly
 * @dev compute the VRF output for any given seed) to bias the outcomes from
 * @dev your contract in their favor. For instance, the block hash is a natural
 * @dev choice of seed for many applications, but miners in control of a
 * @dev substantial fraction of hashing power and with access to VRF outputs
 * @dev could check the result of prospective block hashes as they are mined,
 * @dev and decide not to publish a block if they don't like the outcome it will
 * @dev lead to.
 *
 * @dev On the other hand, using block hashes as the seed makes it particularly
 * @dev easy to estimate the economic cost to a miner for this kind of cheating
 * @dev (namely, the block reward and transaction fees they forgo by refraining
 * @dev from publishing a block.)
